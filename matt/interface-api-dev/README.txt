Originally this folder just contained a copy of Tingxi's new overlay example demonstrating the updated API that OhmniLabs made for us (i.e., with the captureVideo and captureAudio functions). 

Recently, Matt added a button for telling the Ohmni's speaker volume to be 5, demonstrating that we can force a value and thereby override any changes that people make in the classroom by pressing the +/- buttons on the speaker itself.

Now there are also buttons for getting and setting the Bot Volume.
